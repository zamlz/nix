"=which-key= is a minor mode for [[id:cf447557-1f87-4a07-916a-160cfd2310cf][GNU/Emacs]] that displays the key bindings following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter =C-x= and wait for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with all of the available key bindings that follow =C-x= (or as many as space allows given your settings). This includes prefixes like =C-x 8= which are shown in a different face. Screenshots of what the popup will look like are included below. =which-key= started as a rewrite of =guide-key-mode=, but the feature sets have diverged to a certain extent." - [[https://github.com/justbur][justbur]]

There are a couple of different setup modes that we can configure:

|------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Which Key Setup Mode                     | Description                                 |
|------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| which-key-setup-side-window-bottom       | Popup which-key window at the bottom        |
| which-key-setup-side-window-right        | Popup which-key window at the top           |
| which-key-setup-side-window-right-bottom | Favor right side, but if too big use bottom |
| which-key-setup-minibuffer               | Use minibuffer for which-key window         |
|------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
;;(which-key-setup-side-window-right)
;;(which-key-setup-side-window-right-bottom)
;;(which-key-setup-minibuffer)
#+end_src

Since I'm still learning emacs, lets make the delay a little small so that we can quickly see what options are available to us. The secondary delay is for subsequet key strokes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 1.0)
(setq which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.0)
#+end_src

Make sure to provide the module.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-which-key)
#+end_src
