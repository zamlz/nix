* Automatic Table of Contents for Org Files
=org-make-toc= is a simple package for automatically generating table of contents buffers within [[id:ef93dff4-b19f-4835-9002-9d4215f8a6fe][Org-mode]] files. This was very useful when I maintained large files, but now that everything is mostly split up, I seldom use it.
