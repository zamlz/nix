Xorg is an open source implementation of the X window system.

* Configuration
** Package Install
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-xorg.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

Install the =xorg= package if hasn't been installed already

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(zamlz/system-packages-ensure "xorg" "Xorg")
(provide 'init-xorg)
#+end_src

** Better Defaults
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:shell: :tangle ~/.config/xinitrc.d/x11-refresh.sh :mkdirp yes :shebang #!/bin/sh :comments both
:END:

We need to configure various xorg settings here. This might not be the best place as this definetly feels like something that should belong in the =~/.xinitrc=, however, in case they are set to something other than the defaults, it makes sense to be able to reset them here.

The single most important thing! Make the *CAPS LOCK* key into the *ESCAPE* key!

#+begin_src shell
setxkbmap -option caps:escape
#+end_src

Turn off the screen saver.

#+begin_src shell
xset s off
#+end_src

Increases the typing speed of the keyboard by increasing the repeat rate.

#+begin_src shell
xset r rate 400 50
#+end_src

Rehash locally installed fonts

#+begin_src shell
xset +fp $HOME/.local/share/fonts
xset fp rehash
#+end_src
