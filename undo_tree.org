* Visualize The Undo Tree
=undo-tree= provides a simple interface to visualize and traverse the [[id:cf447557-1f87-4a07-916a-160cfd2310cf][GNU/Emacs]] undo tree.

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-undo-tree.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:
** Package Install
Install =undo-tree= like any other package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package undo-tree)
#+end_src

** Initialize the Tree

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-undo-tree-mode)
#+end_src

** Improve Tree Visuals
Let's make sure by default when we see the tree, we also see the diff of each node.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq  undo-tree-visualizer-diff t)
#+end_src

Let's also see the timestamps of when the change was made

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
(setq undo-tree-visualizer-relative-timestamps nil)
#+end_src

** Autosave Undo History
We can confiure =undo-tree= to save the undo history to a file so that it can be persistant over sessions. By default =undo-tree= will attempt to save the history file alongside the file in question. This is messy so let's save it elsewhere as well like the =~/.cache= folder.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq undo-tree-auto-save-history t)
(setq undo-tree-history-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.cache/undo-tree/")))
#+end_src

** Feature Provide

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-undo-tree)
#+end_src
